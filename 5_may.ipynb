    "## Q1. What is meant by time-dependent seasonal components?\n",
    "Time-dependent seasonal components refer to seasonal patterns in time series data that change or evolve over time. Unlike fixed seasonal components, which repeat consistently (e.g., a yearly cycle), time-dependent seasonal components can vary in magnitude, frequency, or shape as time progresses. This means that the seasonal behavior is not static and can be influenced by external factors, making it more complex to model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2. How can time-dependent seasonal components be identified in time series data?\n",
    "Time-dependent seasonal components can be identified using the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization: Plotting the time series can reveal changes in the seasonal pattern over time.\n",
    "Seasonal decomposition (STL): Decomposing the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components using techniques like STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) can highlight evolving seasonal patterns.\n",
    "Sliding window analysis: Applying a moving window to compute seasonal patterns at different time points helps identify shifts in seasonality.\n",
    "Fourier transforms: Analyzing the frequency components in the time series can reveal time-varying seasonal frequencies.\n",
    "## Q3. What are the factors that can influence time-dependent seasonal components?\n",
    "Factors influencing time-dependent seasonal components include:\n",
    "\n",
    "External events: Economic changes, pandemics, or policy shifts can alter seasonal patterns.\n",
    "Market trends: Consumer behavior changes over time, affecting seasonality in sales or demand.\n",
    "Technological advancements: Innovations can modify production cycles or service delivery, influencing seasonal patterns.\n",
    "Climate change: Weather-related seasonal components can shift due to changing climate patterns.\n",
    "## Q4. How are autoregression models used in time series analysis and forecasting?\n",
